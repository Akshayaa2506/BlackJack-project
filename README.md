# BlackJack-project
This is the game called BlackJack created by using python.The players' initial cards may be dealt face-up or face-down (more common in single-deck games). The object of the game is to win money by creating card totals higher than those of the dealer's hand but not exceeding 21, or by stopping at a total in the hope that the dealer will bust.

Rules:
     Players receive all cards face up and the dealer's first card is face up and the second is face down. The object of the game is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21. If a hand goes over 21, it is called a “bust” or “break” and the wager is lost. In 21, Jacks, Queens, Kings and 10s count as 10.
